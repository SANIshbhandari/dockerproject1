# FarmSaathi Logo

## How to Add the Logo

1. Save the FarmSaathi logo image as `logo.png` in this directory (`assets/images/`)
2. The logo should be in PNG format with a transparent background for best results
3. Recommended size: 500x500 pixels or larger (will be automatically resized)

## Current Logo Usage

- **Login Page**: Large logo (200px) in the branding section
- **Signup Page**: Large logo (200px) in the branding section

## Fallback
